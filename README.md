# Sales-by-Territory
This project files contains data about different time segments throughout the week, categorized as
‘Peak’ and ‘Off-Peak’ hours.The dataset was from kaggle.com To create an insightful dashboard, I ideally combine this data with customer sales data. 
This could allow me to analyze sales performance during different time segments and identify potential opportunities for improvement.


I used sales analysis to understand peak and off-peak hours for different cities from USA. Analyzing sales data can provide
valuable insights for optimizing business strategies.Here i used three based factors such as Sales Trend Analysis,Sales Performance and Geographical Sales Analysis.

Sales Trend Analysis:
1.Purpose/businesss need: Identify patterns and trends in sales over time.
2.Process or How: Examine historical sales data to spot recurring cycles, seasonal variations, and long-term growth or decline.
Example: Tracking monthly sales for each city to identify peak seasons.

Sales Performance Analysis:
Purpose: Evaluate the effectiveness of sales efforts.
How: Compare actual sales against targets, analyze conversion rates, and assess individual sales team performance.
Example: Assessing whether a city’s sales team meets their monthly targets.

Geographical Sales Analysis:
Purpose: Compare sales performance across different cities or regions.
How: Analyze total sales, growth rates, and market share for each location.
Example: Determining which cities have the highest sales during peak hours.
